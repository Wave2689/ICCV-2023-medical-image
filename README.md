### BoMD: Bag of Multi-label Descriptors for Noisy Chest X-ray Classification
- Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01937
- Code: https://github.com/cyh-0/BoMD
- Keywords: Noisy Multi-label; CXR; BERT; Graph
- Description
Deep learning methods have shown outstanding classification accuracy in medical imaging problems, which is largely attributed to the availability of large-scale datasets manually annotated with clean labels.

CLIP-Driven Universal Model for Organ Segmentation and Tumor Detection
- Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00785
- Code: https://github.com/ljwztc/CLIP-Driven-Universal-Model
- Keywords: CLIP; Organ Segmentation; Tumor Detection; 
- Description
 The proposed model is developed from an assembly of 14 datasets, using a total of 3, 410 CT scans for training and then evaluated on 6, 162 external CT scans from 3 additional datasets.

Taxonomy Adaptive Cross-Domain Adaptation in Medical Imaging via Optimization Trajectory Distillation
- Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14709.pdf
- Code: https://github.com/camwew/TADA-MI
- Keywords: Unsupervised domain adaptation 
- Description
We propose optimization trajectory distillation, a unified approach to address the two technical challenges from a new perspective: common characteristics of the domain shifts and incoherent label sets,  dynamics along network training

PRIOR: Prototype Representation Joint Learning from Medical Images and Reports
- Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.12577.pdf
- Code: https://github.com/QtacierP/PRIOR
- Keywords: Prototype representation learning; reconstructing long reports; Self-Supervised Learning
- Description
In this paper, we present a prototype representation learning framework incorporating both global andlocal alignment between medical images and reports.
